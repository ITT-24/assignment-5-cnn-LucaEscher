# Task 1

## Format Time:

```
write a function that  turns this 0.13464999198913574 in seconds

ChatGPT
Here's a function to convert a duration given in seconds (e.g., 0.13464999198913574 seconds) into a more human-readable format, breaking it down into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds:

python
Code kopieren
def format_duration(seconds):
    # Convert seconds to hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds
    hours = int(seconds // 3600)
    minutes = int((seconds % 3600) // 60)
    seconds = seconds % 60
    milliseconds = int((seconds - int(seconds)) * 1000)
    
    # Format the duration string
    formatted_duration = f"{hours} hours, {minutes} minutes, {int(seconds)} seconds, {milliseconds} milliseconds"
    return formatted_duration

# Example usage
duration_in_seconds = 0.13464999198913574
formatted_duration = format_duration(duration_in_seconds)
print(formatted_duration)
Explanation:
Hours Calculation:

hours = int(seconds // 3600): Divides the total seconds by 3600 (number of seconds in an hour) and takes the integer part.
Minutes Calculation:

minutes = int((seconds % 3600) // 60): Takes the remainder after removing the hours (using seconds % 3600), divides by 60 (number of seconds in a minute), and takes the integer part.
Seconds Calculation:

seconds = seconds % 60: Takes the remainder after removing the hours and minutes.
Milliseconds Calculation:

milliseconds = int((seconds - int(seconds)) * 1000): Subtracts the integer part of seconds to get the fractional part, multiplies by 1000 to convert to milliseconds, and takes the integer part.
Formatting:

Combines the calculated hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds into a readable string format.
When you run this function with 0.13464999198913574 seconds as input, it will print a formatted string representing the duration. For the given example, the output will be:

Code kopieren
0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, 134 milliseconds
```



# Task 2

## Capturing pictures

```
write me a python script that captures picture from my webcam with cv2 and resize the image to 1920 Ã— 1080 px and saves it to folder which I can specify

ChatGPT
Sure, here's a Python script that captures an image from your webcam using OpenCV, resizes it to 1920x1080 pixels, and saves it to a specified folder:

python
Code kopieren
import cv2
import os

def capture_and_resize_image(output_folder, filename='captured_image.jpg', width=1920, height=1080):
    # Check if the output folder exists, create if not
    if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
        os.makedirs(output_folder)

    # Open a connection to the webcam (0 is usually the built-in webcam)
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Error: Could not open webcam.")
        return

    # Read a frame from the webcam
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    if not ret:
        print("Error: Could not read frame.")
        cap.release()
        return

    # Resize the frame to the desired size
    resized_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (width, height))

    # Build the full path for the output file
    output_path = os.path.join(output_folder, filename)

    # Save the image
    cv2.imwrite(output_path, resized_frame)
    print(f"Image saved to {output_path}")

    # Release the webcam
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Example usage
output_folder = '/path/to/your/folder'  # Specify your output folder here
capture_and_resize_image(output_folder)
Explanation:
Importing Libraries:

cv2 for handling the webcam and image processing.
os for file and directory operations.
Function capture_and_resize_image:

output_folder: Path to the folder where the captured image will be saved.
filename: Name of the saved image file.
width and height: Desired dimensions for the resized image.
Folder Check and Creation:

Check if the specified output folder exists. If not, create it.
Opening Webcam:

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0): Open the default webcam. Use 0 for the default webcam, 1 for an external webcam, etc.
Reading Frame:

ret, frame = cap.read(): Capture a frame from the webcam. ret is a boolean indicating if the frame was read successfully.
Resizing Image:

cv2.resize(frame, (width, height)): Resize the captured frame to the specified dimensions.
Saving Image:

cv2.imwrite(output_path, resized_frame): Save the resized image to the specified path.
Release Resources:

cap.release(): Release the webcam.
cv2.destroyAllWindows(): Close any OpenCV windows.
Running the Script:
Replace '/path/to/your/folder' with the path to the folder where you want to save the captured image.
Run the script, and it will capture an image from your webcam, resize it to 1920x1080 pixels, and save it to the specified folder.
